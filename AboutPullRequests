Pull requests: A way to collabrate with people to get your code reviewed or even bring in the changes. You can even pull in requests in your own repository.
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, youâ€™re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

How did I achieved all of this?
-Clicked on Pull requests tab.
-Selected readme-edits in comparison with master as 'base' branch.
-Looked onto the changes.
-Finally clicked on 'create pull request'.

Now I had to make these changes visible in my original master readme file. So steps to merge pull request:
-Clicked on confirm merge.
-Deleted the readme-edits branch as all of its changes were incorporated.
