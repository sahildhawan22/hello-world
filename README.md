# hello-world
Just on my way to learn Github!
------------------------------------------
Ok this is what I've learnt so far about Github:

Branching: Work on another version of my repository, so as to make edits before committing them to 'master'. This new branch we create is called feature. This is actually snapshot or copy of master. 

Forking: When you make changtes to someone else's project but they remainn only in your account. If original author wants to commit your changes to the code, he can 'pull' my changes.

Clone: When you download someone else's code on your local machine.

Ok how did I achieve this editing?
1. Clicked on branch-master and write a new name for the branch.
2. When the new branch got created, I clicked on pencil symbol and lo and behold, here I'm working on this feature branch!

Now off to commit them, by clicking Commit in the end so as to merge this with the readme-edits branch.
